# ClimPy
Python utils for atmospheric &amp; ocean sciences. Includes tools for popular datasets such as Aeronet, models (WRF, ROMS), satellite retrieval products (MODIS, SEVIRI) and so on.

[Aeronet Tutorial (Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/SeregaOsipov/ClimPy/blob/master/examples/aeronet_examples.ipynb) explains how to read, plot, and analyze Aeronet products. It also includes comparison of the Aeronet with the model simulation (WRF-Chem).

[Script](https://github.com/SeregaOsipov/ClimPy/blob/master/climpy/aeronet_wrf_domain_comparison.py) to validate WRF-Chem simulation against Aeronet products. See the source code for details.
